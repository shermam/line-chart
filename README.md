Line Chart

I created this one to try to count steps. It is an attempt to learn how to do this from scratch.
The idea is to capture data from the motion sensor on my cellphone. Send it to a monitor page on my pc using signalhub. Plot a line chart to visualize the data and help understand it. And then develop a way to identify the steps.
